Project git: https://gitlab.cern.ch/boyang/ttH_fakes

This project analyse n-tuples generated from 2 frameworks: xTauFramework(hadhad+jets channel); ttHML framework(channels involve leptons)

the list of Datasets is in datafiles/

Requirements:

	plotTools
		https://gitlab.cern.ch/boyang/plotTools (need compile for shared libraries)
		And its requirements:
			http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page

	external tools:
		frugally-deep: https://github.com/Dobiasd/frugally-deep.git
		And its requirements:
			http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page (You already have it if you installed plotTools)
			https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/dobiasd/FunctionalPlus
			https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nlohmann/json

Installation:
	
	source setup.sh

How to run:

	source env.sh
	run hadhadpreparejobs.sh(tthmlpreparejobs.sh) to get the address of the rootfiles from xTauFramework(ttHML framework)
	run reduce_run to reduce n-tuples
	run trainBDT to train the BDT
	run make_plots_run to analyse the histograms

In case you use TRexFitter (https://gitlab.cern.ch/TRExStats/TRExFitter), to produce the fitter input:

	run make_plots_run and set doTrex in to 1 and doPlot to 0
