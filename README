Project git: https://gitlab.cern.ch/boyang/ttH_fakes

This project analyse n-tuples generated from 2 frameworks: xTauFramework(hadhad+jets channel); ttHML framework(channels involve leptons)

the list of Datasets is in datafiles/

To run this project, you need

	somewhere/plotTools
		https://gitlab.cern.ch/boyang/plotTools (need compile for shared libraries)

	somewhere/tools/
		frugally-deep (and the required projected for this one: eigen): https://github.com/Dobiasd/frugally-deep.git (header library, dont need compile)

Compile:
	
	set TOOLDIR in the CMakeList.txt to somewhere/tools
	set PLOTTOOLDIR in the CMakeList.txt to somewhere/plotTools

	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	make
	cd ..

source env.sh every time you come back to analysis

For "hadhad+jets channel":

	run scripts/hadhadpreparejobs.sh to get the address of the rootfiles
	run xtfw_reduce*_run to reduce n-tuples
	run tth_trainBDT to train the BDT
	run xtfw_fcnc_analysis_run to analyse the histograms

For "lepton channels":

	run tth_reduce*_run to reduce n-tuples (only available on nersc.gov)
	run tth_trainBDT to train the BDT
	run tth__fcnc_analysis_run to analyse the histograms
